# Comp 271 - Assignment Two

## Due November 15, 2022

### Step One - fork the repository to your own GitHub space - 5 points

Click the "Fork" button in the upper right hand corner of the GitHub view.

### Step Two - Implement the length() method in the SinglyLinkedList class - 5 points

You only need to implement the length() method to make all the tests in 
SinglyLinkedListTest pass.   You may use any implementation whatsoever.

### Step Three - Implement the DoublyLinkedList class - 50 points

Implement all the methods of the DoublyLinkedList class.  
You will know you are done when all the tests in DoublyLinkedListTest pass.
 
**Note**: DoublyLinkedList has an additional method - toReverseOrderString()!

**Implement this method last, after all the others are working!!**

Implementing this method correctly is only possible if you have implemented the rest of the 
methods correctly!
